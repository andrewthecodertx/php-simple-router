# SimpleRouter

SimpleRouter is a lightweight PHP routing library that helps you define and
handle HTTP routes easily. It allows you to create routes for different
HTTP methods (GET, POST) and execute corresponding callbacks when a
matching route is found.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can include the SimpleRouter class in your project by copying the
provided Router class file into your project directory.

### Usage

1. **Define Routes:**
Use `get` and `post` methods of the `Router` class to define routes. The routes
consist of a path and a callback that will be executed when the route is matched.

```php
// Using a closure
Router::get('/info', function() {
  phpinfo();
});

// Using a controller method
Router::get('/user/{name}', [Controllers\Controller::class, 'show']);
Router::post('/submit', [Controllers\Controller::class, 'submitForm']);
```

You can use dynamic segments in the path by enclosing them in curly braces.

1. **Dispatch Routes:**
Create a `Request` object representing the incoming HTTP request and pass it to
the `dispatch` method of the `Router` to find and execute the matching route.

```php
$request = new Request('GET', 'home/John');
$response = Router::dispatch($request);
```

1. **Handle Responses:**
The `dispatch` method returns a `Response` object generated by the matched
route's callback.
You can then handle and manipulate the response as needed.

```php
echo $response->getBody();
```
